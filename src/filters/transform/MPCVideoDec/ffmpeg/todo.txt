1) There's a macroblocking problem when seeking with some 1080p h264 videos
   (it's present in the trunk builds too)
   Sample:  http://www.mediafire.com/?w984256zcsvmu
2) Multithreading doesn't work if DXVA is enabled and the decoder fails back to software mode
3) Crash with h264 software decoder (x64 only)
4) unable to playback E-AC3 track (need rewrite MpaDecFilter)
5) x64 build, unable to playback Hi10P video stream (x86 playback is fine)
6) x64 debug build, crash on seek on H.264 video stream
